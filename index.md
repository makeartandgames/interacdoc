## Introduction

This website explores the potential of cognitive linguistics to inform composition pedagogy. To begin with, I limit myself to a discussion of [conceptual metaphor](), as pioneered by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson[^lakoff]. I follow this with a brief venture into [register]() to demonstrate the field's flexibility.

This site won't discuss cognitive linguistics (I occasionally use the term _stylistics_) in broad. Instead, this website will demonstrate, by example, the potential of conceptual metaphor as: 

  1. A learning tool for _students_ exploring rhetoric and critical reading;
  2. A metacognitive tool for _teachers_ to reflect on their experience of teaching and writing.

## Justification

Cognitive Linguistics is:

 * Highly adaptable. Whereas traditional rhetoric evolved around a specific context and category of speech-act, cognitive linguists attempt to discuss language use "in general." The ideas of stylistics do not privilege persuasive or poetic modes. Linguistic insights can help students become "rhetorically flexible." Nor is it attached to a particular "standard english." Instead, cognitive linguistics is concerned with _how_ and _why_ something works, rather than prescribing what to do. 
 * Student agency is primary. "Stylistics explores how readers interact with the language of texts in order to explain how we understand and are affected by, texts when we read them."[^scott]
 * A Deep Structure. Ideas like [Conceptual Metaphor](), [Figure and Ground](), or [Register]() are rich, with their own sub-concepts. Each provides its own sub-concepts and has rich potential for exploration.


## Conceptual Metaphor

### Background: Metaphors for Writing

We'll consider some examples of metaphor, and analyze them using the cognitive-linguistic framework popularized by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in their book _Metaphors We Live By_.

> English speakers routinely talk about writing as if it were speech, characterizing their inability t understand a text as difficulty understanding what that text is "saying," speaking of a writer's "voice" or "tone," describing readers as an "audience," and so forth. This habit conceals an essential difference: speech is natural in the sense that as modern homo sapiense, we've been speaking to one another for nearly two hundred thousand years. Our speech has been bound up in complex feedback loops with our physiology . . . and our cognition" which can lead us to "comparing them to the ease with which they [students] usually speak."[^dryer]

Dryer is relying on the common metaphor WRITING IS SPEECH (an instance of the _conceptual metaphor_ COMMUNICATION IS SPEECH[^metaphorlist]). Metaphor can be described as a relationship between the metaphor's *source* (here, SPEECH) and its *target* (WRITING). Lakoff elaborates: "the common properties between the [source and target] constitute the **ground** of the metaphor" blended into a "new emergent understanding."[^lakoff] The most obvious common property here is that speech and writing are both ways of comunicating using language. Dryer then goes on to iterate "metaphor [is] a mapping of properties between the two spaces or domains" maps "properties between the two domains"[^simpson].

Conceptual metaphors are "underlying conceptual structures that in turn are shared by groups of people"[^simpson]. These conceptual tend to be more broad and sweeping. conceptual metaphors are frequently evoked [^lakoff]

Lakoff uses as an example the conceptual metaphor "ARGUMENT IS WAR." This metaphor is reflected in our everyday language through a wide variety of expressions:

> ARGUMENT IS WAR\
> Your claims are **indefensible**.\
> He attacked every **weak point** in my argument. \
> His criticisms were right on **target**.\
> I *demolished* his argument.[^lakoff] 

As another example, the conceptual metaphor LIFE IS A JOURNEY can be expressed as "she strayed from the **path**" or with 'sub-metaphors' such as AGING IS A ROAD. Importantly, these individual expressions bring to the discourse the larger conceptual metaphor, activating an unconscious and expansive range of mapped properties. 
"these metaphorical patterns are so strong and widespread that we can even understand our philosophical view of life itself as being founded not on an objective world but on a set of metaphorical representations"

### Classroom Applications
Composition teachers might consider the following suggestions:

        1. Be deliberate with your use of metaphor.

For example, stating that writing is a PROCESS rather than a PRODUCT 
will be more useful if the teacher's individual expressions 
support and evoke the first metaphor over the second.  Furthermore, try to make conscious use of metaphors that are supported by your students' backgrounds (more on this below). 

        2. Explore metaphor as a rhetorical tool. 

   I have attempted to demonstrate this second point with small analyses throughout. Metaphors are important rhetorical tools. Individual metaphors that are re-used throughout a text make for important patterns that can be targeted in annotations. Students can point to metaphors as evidence of a particular rhetorical technique; this might make for a good low-stakes assignment. The hope is that metaphors are a common-enough textual phenomenon that students understand, and so can offer them something concrete to think about as they read and write rhetorically.

Here are a few places in the 101 curriculum where you could make use of this tool:

      - Week 1 - Metacognition / rhetorical reading, as an example of metacognition, 
      - Week 7 - Critical Reading and note-taking, as an example of patterns within a text
      - Throughout the semester, when discussing course readings (example below).

   The usefulness of metaphor for students will depend largely on whether or not students can broaden their understanding of metaphor outside of its meaning as poetic, figurative language (as seen in literature classes). Some of ENGH 101's readings make little use of this more familiar kind of metaphor. It may be useful to discuss metaphor as 'comparison.'

   There are exceptions, however; consider the many explicit metaphors that Newkirk deploys in his opening to _Growing Up in the Shadow of the Confederacy_:[^newkirk]
~~~ sdparse 
... granite figures/target of soldiers were as immovable/property and immutable/property as the hills/source and the lakes/source . Other symbols of the South as it was before 1865 were also part of the fabric/source of reality/target . Old battle flags/target were inevitabilities/source , waving/elaboration in the wind. Plantations/target might as well have been wonders/source of the world, and old battlefields/target holy places/source .

is-a(figures, hills)
is-a(figures, lakes)
is-a(reality, fabric)
is-a(flags, inevitabilities)
is-a(Plantations, wonders)
is-a(battlefields, places)
~~~


   Note that, in using these concepts in the classroom, the teacher will be more careful with their deployment of jargon than I have here, and will limit their discussion to a select few ideas. The teacher will also need to keep in mind, naturally, the backgrounds of their students. Keep in mind that a great deal of Mason students are international students. While some conceptual metaphors appear to be universal (i.e., UP IS GOOD), most are not, and even the most pervasive metaphors will vary greatly in their expressions across cultures. Make sure to discuss examples that your students can understand. 


### When up is down 

Consider the following teaching problem from _How Learning Works_:

> Every year in my introductory psychology class I teach my students about classic learning theory, particularly the concepts of positive and negative reinforcement. I know that these can be tough concepts for students to grasp, so I spell out very clearly that __reinforcement__ always refers to increasing a behavior and __punishment__ always refers to decreasing a behavior. I also emphasize that, contrary to what they might assume, __negative reinforcement__ does not mean punishment; it means removing something aversive to increase a desired behavior. I also provide a number of concrete examples to illustrate what I mean. But it seems that no matter how much I explain the concept, students continue to think of negative reinforcement as punishment. In fact, when I asked about negative reinforcement on a recent exam, almost 60 percent of the class got it wrong. Why is this so hard for students to understand?[^ambrose]

Ambrose et. al. provide  the following explanation:

> In Professor Dione's case it is not what students do __not__ know that hurts them but rather what they __do__ know. His students, like many of us, have come to associate positive with "good" and negative with "bad,"  When students are introduced to the concept of negative reinforcement in relation to classic learning theory, their prior understanding of "negative" may interfere with their ability to absorb the technical definition . . . students interpret the word "negative" to imply a negative response, or punishment.[^ambrose]

This "association" is brought about by a very common conceptual metaphor: POSITIVE IS GOOD, or even more generally, UP IS GOOD. UP IS GOOD is so common and integral to our everyday speech as to make us unaware of its presence. Consider:

> I'm on the up-and-up.\
> I'm feeling down today.\
> They really raised the bar. 

Let's see this in the text:
~~~ sdparse
I spell out very clearly that reinforcement/UP always refers to increasing/UP a behavior and punishment/BAD always refers to decreasing/DOWN a behavior/QUANTITY. I also emphasize that, contrary to what they might assume, negative/DOWN reinforcement/UP does not mean punishment/BAD ; it means removing/DOWN something aversive/BAD to increase/UP a desired/GOOD behavior/QUANTITY . . . students continue to think of negative/DOWN reinforcement/UP as punishment/BAD . 
~~~
   

> In other words, their prior knowledge  triggers an inappropriate association that ultimately intrudes on and distorts the incoming knowledge.[^ambrose]

But it's not simply a case of "prior knowledge" competing with new information on an equal basis. UP IS GOOD is knowledge of a different kind than what Dione has to offer the class. Nor is Professor Dione likely to strip students of this conceptual metaphor or its hold over them. 

Note that *reinforcement* is already associated with SUPPORT/INCREASE/UP. 

~~~ sdparse
negative/DOWN reinforcement/UP does not mean punishment; it means removing/DOWN something aversive to increase/UP a desired behavior
~~~

Further, the annotation above shows that even stripped of students' GOOD/UP association, the teacher's explanation of negative reinforcement contains a series of UP/DOWN or INCREASE/DECREASE alternations. One can see how this would be confusing.

A 'grammar of rhetoric' empowers the student. It provides atomic abstractions;

Providing the "smallest units" grants the student maximal autonomy, rather than rules-of-thumb based on larger grammatical structures.  Rather than evaluating a text's as "good" or "bad" writing or more or less "correct", stylistics catalogs the text as a series of overlapping and interacting structures that create an experience in the reader.

Cognitive linguists believe that language metaphors derive from somatic experiences constituted at an extremely young age.  Language is then implicitly embodied.  According to this view, Language is shaped by metaphor, rather than the other way around.  

A relatively small number of metaphors shape our thought.  This has two important implications: 

    1. How we understand something is, at least in part, a function of metaphors we use;
    2. Meaning-making is deeply connected to an embodied experience. 

This second point could help explain why some students see better results with  non-linguistic learning programs.  A traditional teaching model might treat e.g. diagrams or visual representations as "aids" to the primary and privileged textual information. But if meaning is rooted in an embodied experience, then its visual, linguistic, etc. manifestations are equal attempts at expression.

## Register 

"A register is a fixed pattern of vocabulary and grammar which regularly co-occurs with and is conventionally associated with a specific context." [^simpson] Register is closely related to genre; it may be useful to think of register as the sentence-level expression of genre.

> field = the setting and purpose of the interaction\
> tenor = the relationship between the participants in interaction\
> mode = the medium of communication (i.e., whether it is spoken or written)[^simpson]

Consider the following excerpt from _"I Learned to Embrace My Chinese-American Identity Through My Voice"_:[^voice]

<div class="sdparse" id="register-parse" tabs="yes">
I/PERSONAL quickly fell into one of the stereotypes of Asians, especially Asian girls — one of quietness and reservedness/ACADEMIC . But it wasn’t because I’m shy/PERSONAL or like/PERSONAL being quiet, it was because I didn’t feel/PERSONAL like I could contribute/ACADEMIC something of value/ACADEMIC . Because all of the beloved female/ACADEMIC characters on the Disney/PERSONAL and Nickelodeon/PERSONAL TV/PERSONAL shows/PERSONAL I did watch and all of the mono-ethnic/ACADEMIC groups/ACADEMIC of popular/PERSONAL girls/PERSONAL at my/PERSONAL school/PERSONAL made me feel/PERSONAL that I didn’t have a place on their platform/ACADEMIC ; that my identity/ACADEMIC was not worth the same visibility/ACADEMIC and respect/ACADEMIC . 
</div>

I've chosen, somewhat arbitrarily, to label these registers as _personal_ and _academic_. But we could just as easily categorize some of these words as _teen_ and _scholarly_, or _casual_ and _archaic_. Indeed, more registers would be more accurate. On the other hand, two registers seems appropriate here, given the nature of the article. The Narrative Argument essay, after all, demands a mix of at least two registers; one for narrative, and one for argument. 


### Lexical Sets: 

**Personal**

> I / me / shy / like / quiet / feel / TV / Disney / Nickelodeon / popular / girls / school / feel

**Academic**

> reservedness / contribute / value / mono-ethnic / groups / platform / identiy / visibility / respect

Note how the 'Academic' set contains complex latinate words of longer length.

### Grammatical Patterns
These registers are also marked by particular patterns of syntax. The words in the brackets indicate the 'slots' these structures leave open. For example, one might find, in a purely academic text, something like:

> It was one of happiness and solace.

__Academic__

 > the same [visibility] and [respect]

 > one of [quietness] and [reservedness]

 > have a place on their [platform]

__Personal__ 

> I didn’t feel like I could [...]

> because I'm [shy]

> made me feel [that I didn't...]

## Modality and Agency in a Teaching Text

### Agency via Cogntive Grammar

~~~ sdparse
 [teacher]/(elided) providing students/PATIENT with choices/OBJECT, such as in the topics they focus on or in the format of their work , can empower , engage , and motivate them/RECIPIENT ./. Given that students enduring stress and trauma may lower/RESOURCE their attention/RESOURCE and motivation/RESOURCE , it can be useful to provide students with options/RESOURCE when it is feasible and aligned with your goals/ACHIEVEMENT for the course. It is important to note that students/AGENT can feel overwhelmed if there is too much choice/RESOURCE or not enough support/RESOURCE in making their choices.
acts-on([teacher], students)
metaphorical([teacher], students)
acts(motivate, them)
acts-on(trauma, lower)
modal(feel, overwhelmed)
~~~


When action is granted to students, it is often mediated by a teacher (who acts as a kind of enabler). In other cases, students agency is presented as possiblity using [modal]() markers. Modal auxiliaries act as a kind of "grammatical hedging." 

But there are a number of different kinds of Modality. Here are a few:
 - Ability
 - Desirability 
 - Permission 
 - Likelihood

Applied to the text:

~~~ sdparse
 Providing/CERTAIN students with choices, such as in the topics they focus on or in the format of their work , can/ABILITY empower, engage, and motivate them. Given that students enduring stress and trauma may/LIKELIHOOD lower their attention and motivation, it can/DESIRABILITY be useful to provide students with options/ABILITY when it is feasible/ABILITY and aligned with your goals for the course. It is important to note that students can/LIKELIHOOD feel overwhelmed if/ABILITY there is too much choice or not enough support in making their choices.
possible(choices,-1, students-1)

## Further Questions
 - How does the idea of register compete with the concept of genre? Are the concepts redundant?
 - What metaphors about writing and reading shape our understanding and experience? We discussed "writing is a product/process. What metaphors shape our teaching? 
 - Does the "atomic" or nature of these linguistic ideas make them too difficult or "advanced" for a 100-level course? Certainly, if they were adopted directly from a technical text such as this one--but then:
 - How should the technical aspects be pared down for student ingestion? What jargon should be kept?
 - The analysis here has limited itself to very short texts, and cognitive linguistics is currently best suited to short passages. What is missed with the use of short passages? What is gained?

## TODO 
TODO:
 - Explain the exigence for your research question and why an answer to this question is important for first-year composition instructors.
 - Summarize and synthesize what you already knew and what you learned about this research question from the research that you did into your research question. When integrating a reading, identify the author, include an in-text parenthetical citation with the page or paragraph number referenced, and include a full bibliographic entry on a reference page.
 - Identify what you see as the “best practice” in relation to your research question and the Mason context and explain the nuances and complexities inherent in answering the research question. In other words, work to contextualize this answer into best practices specific to our teaching site with regard to our composition program’s ideologies, our particular student population, etc. 
 - Discuss what new questions or complexities arose during your research that remain unanswered or unaddressed and how new first-year composition teachers at Mason might grapple with those lingering issues.
